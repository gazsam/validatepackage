<p class="p">This password is changed to match the one set for the first administrative user created in the Management Console. Once you've set up the primary Application Lifecycle Service admin account, use that account's password when logging in to the VM at the command line.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic31232__server-config-hostname"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Changing the Hostname</h2> 
  <p class="p">You may want or need to change the hostname of the Application Lifecycle Service system, either to match a DNS record you've created or just to make the system URLs more convenient. This can be done using the <a class="xref" href="../reference/kato-ref.html#topic39432__kato-command-ref-node-rename">kato node rename</a> command:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">kato node rename mynewname.example.com</pre>

  <p class="p">This command will change the system hostname in <em class="ph i">/etc/hostname</em> and <em class="ph i">/etc/hosts,</em> as well as performing some internal configuration for Application Lifecycle Service such as generating a new server certificate for the <a class="xref" href="../../user/console/console_index.html#topic8844">Management Console</a>.</p>

<p class="p">mDNS is only supported with ".local" hostnames. If you want to give the

          </a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic31232__changing-ip-addresses"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Changing IP Addresses</h2> 
  <p class="p">The Application Lifecycle Service <em class="ph i">micro cloud</em> server is initially set up for <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/glossary.html#topic6187__term-DHCP">DHCP</a> and <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/glossary.html#topic6187__term-multicast-dns">multicast DNS</a>. This is often sufficient for local testing, but in this
        configuration has only a single node and can only be privately routed.</p>

<p class="p">As you move toward production use of the server, further configuration
of IP addresses and hostnames will therefore be required. A production
Application Lifecycle Service server will most likely be a
  <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/glossary.html#topic6187__term-cluster">cluster</a> consisting
of several nodes and some of them will require IP addresses and corresponding hostnames.</p>

<p class="p">If your server is to be exposed to the Internet, these addresses must be
routable and the hostnames must appear in the global DNS. Even if your
server is to be part of a <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/glossary.html#topic6187__term-privatePaaS">
<em class="ph i">private
PaaS</em>
</a> for
organizational use only, it must still integrate fully with your network
services, DHCP and DNS in particular. Finally, in the rare case that
such services are not available, the Application Lifecycle Service can be configured with static IP addresses and hostnames.</p>

<p class="p">Before we examine these scenarios in detail, let's review the separation
  of roles in a <a class="xref" href="../cluster/cluster_index.html">cluster</a>:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">core</strong> node which we conventionally call <samp class="ph codeph">api.helion-xxxx.local</samp> in a micro cloud will be given its own hostname and IP address in a cluster so that you can reach it from both the <a class="xref" href="../../user/console/console_index.html#topic8844">Management Console</a> and the command line.</li>

<li class="li">At the same time, the other nodes in the cluster will also need to reach the core node, so whatever address is configured on its network interface will have to be known to the network, the primary node, and all the other nodes. This can be the same as the primary address assigned to the core, or a secondary address used purely within the cluster.</li>

<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">router</strong> nodes, if separate from the primary, will each require IP addresses of their own, reachable from any load balancer and through any firewall that you put in front of them.</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">Where you configure these hostnames and IP addresses will depend on how
you operate your data center network. You will want to confer with your
network administrator about this, starting with the MAC address
configured for each VM in the hypervisor. If your site supports a
significant number of VMs, DHCP may be set up to map MAC addresses to IP
addresses in a particular way. For example, a certain range of MAC
addresses may be used for servers in the DMZ, and another range for
internal servers. If you follow this convention, your Application Lifecycle Service server
will obtain an appropriate IP address automatically. DNS at your site
may establish a similar convention, which you will want to follow when
making any name or address changes within the cluster.</p>

<p class="p">Having determined the hostnames of cluster nodes to be managed by <a class="xref" href="#topic31232__server-config-dns">
          <em class="ph i">DNS</em>
        </a>, the hostname on the primary node should be set using <a class="xref" href="#topic31232__server-config-hostname"><em class="ph i">kato node rename</em></a>
        .</p>

<p class="p">Finally, if you must set a static IP on any cluster node, be sure to
test it before making the change permanent, otherwise you may not be
able to reach the node once it reboots. Assuming that the primary
address is on interface <samp class="ph codeph">eth0</samp>, a secondary address
<samp class="ph codeph">10.0.0.1/24</samp> could be set up temporarily as
follows:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">ipcalc -nb 10.0.0.1/24
Address:   10.0.0.1
Netmask:   255.255.255.0 = 24
Wildcard:  0.0.0.255
=&gt;
Network:   10.0.0.0/24
HostMin:   10.0.0.1
HostMax:   10.0.0.254
Broadcast: 10.0.0.255
Hosts/Net: 254                   Class A, Private Internet
sudo ifconfig eth0:1 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.0.255 up</pre>

<p class="p">Configure another cluster node using a different address on the same
subnet, and be sure that <samp class="ph codeph">ping</samp> works correctly on
the new addresses. You should also use this opportunity to ping the
router and DNS server for this subnet. Check with your network
administrator for their addresses.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic31232__setting-a-static-ip"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting a Static IP</h2> 
  <p class="p">The easiest way to configure an Application Lifecycle Service VM with a static IP address is to use the <a class="xref" href="../reference/kato-ref.html#topic39432__kato-command-ref-op-static_ip">kato op static_ip</a> command.</p>

<p class="p">This command will prompt for the following inputs:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">static IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.1)</li>

<li class="li">netmask (e.g. 255.255.255.0)</li>

<li class="li">network gateway (e.g. 10.0.0.254)</li>

<li class="li">(optional) comma-separated list of DNS names servers (e.g.
10.0.0.252, 10.0.0.253)</li>

<li class="li">(optional) comma-separated list of DNS search domains (e.g.
example.com, example.org)</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">
<samp class="ph codeph">kato</samp> will verify the IP addresses given are within legal ranges,
automatically calculate the network / broadcast addresses for you, and
prompt for the <em class="ph i">sudo</em> password to write the changes.</p>

<p class="p">The command can be run non-interactively with the following arguments:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">--interface</li>

<li class="li">--ip</li>

<li class="li">--netmask</li>

<li class="li">--gateway</li>

<li class="li">--dns-nameservers (set empty "" to skip)</li>

<li class="li">--dns-search-domains (set empty "" to skip)</li>

<li class="li">--restart-network</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">If the IP address provided differs from the previous one, and the node isn't configured as a micro cloud, <a class="xref" href="../reference/kato-ref.html#topic39432__kato-command-ref-node-migrate">kato node migrate</a> is run automatically.</p>

<p class="p">As a precaution, the command does not automatically restart networking
services. To do so, run the following commands:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart</pre>

<p class="p">You will see a deprecation warning about the <samp class="ph codeph">restart</samp> option, which can safely be ignored in this context.</p>

<div class="p">
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you are setting a new static IP <em class="ph i">after</em> having configured a cluster, you must
          reconfigure all other nodes in the cluster to use the new MBUS IP address. Run <a class="xref" href="../reference/kato-ref.html#topic39432__kato-command-ref-node-attach">kato node attach</a> on all non-Core nodes.</div>

      </div>

<p class="p">Alternatively, these changes could be made by editing the <em class="ph i">/etc/network/interfaces</em> file manually. For example:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.0.0.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 10.0.0.0
    broadcast 10.0.0.255
    gateway 10.0.0.254
    dns-nameservers 10.0.0.252, 10.0.0.253
    dns-search example.com, example.org</pre>

<p class="p">When DHCP is not used, DNS server IP addresses must be set explicitly
using the <samp class="ph codeph">dns-nameservers</samp> directive as shown
above. Multiple DNS servers can be specified in a comma separated list.</p>

<div class="p">
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
          <samp class="ph codeph">dnsmasq</samp> does not necessarily reinitialize on <samp class="ph codeph">SIGHUP</samp>.
          Therefore, perform the following to reinitialize:</div>

      </div>

<pre class="pre codeblock">sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart</pre>

<p class="p">Or use <samp class="ph codeph">sudo shutdown -r</samp> to exercise a complete
restart. Then use <samp class="ph codeph">ifconfig</samp> to check that the
interface has been configured, and <samp class="ph codeph">ping</samp> to check
routing to other hosts on the subnet and out in the world. Finally, use
<samp class="ph codeph">dig @&lt;DNS SERVER IP&gt; &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;</samp> to check that DNS
is resolving correctly.</p>

<p class="p">In the event of troubleshooting, you can confirm which DNS servers are
being used by dnsmasq by checking the file
<em class="ph i">/var/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf</em>.</p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  There may be a performance advantage in locally defining a private secondary IP address
          (<a class="xref" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918" target="_blank">RFC

        to it. See your network administrator for advice on which addresses and subnets are
        permissible. Once you have this secondary address set up, see the <a class="xref" href="#topic31232__server-config-etc-hosts"><em class="ph i">/etc/hosts</em></a> section
        for final configuration of the server.</div>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic31232__server-config-etc-hosts"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Modifying /etc/hosts</h2> 
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp> file is used to resolve certain
essential or local hostnames without calling upon the DNS. Unless you
need to <a class="xref" href="#topic31232__server-config-hostname">change the local hostname</a>, you will
in general <em class="ph i">not</em> have to edit <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp> manually,
but when troubleshooting network issues it never hurts to verify that
the file is configured correctly.</p>

<p class="p">As well, various components in a
<a class="xref" href="../cluster/cluster_index.html">Cluster</a> rely on finding the
cluster nodes in <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp>: the Cloud Controller
and the RabbitMQ service in particular.</p>

<p class="p">Application Lifecycle Service will automatically configure <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp>
  on the virtual machine with one entry for the <samp class="ph codeph">localhost</samp> loopback address and another for the <a class="xref" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918" target="_blank">RFC 1918</a> private IP address of
the cluster's Primary node, for example "10.0.0.1" or "192.168.0.1". All
communication between cluster nodes should be strictly through their
private IP addresses and not on routable addresses provided by the DNS.</p>

<p class="p">Remember that <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp> does not support
wildcards. You must use some form of <a class="xref" href="#topic31232__server-config-dns">DNS</a> for
that.</p>

<p class="p">Consider an Application Lifecycle Service instance called <samp class="ph codeph">helion-test</samp>
in domain <samp class="ph codeph">example.com</samp>. The following example is
  what you should expect to see on a <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/glossary.html#topic6187__term-micro-cloud">micro cloud</a>
installation, where all roles are running on the same node:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">hostname

ifconfig eth0

10.0.0.1        helion-test.example.com api.helion-test.example.com</pre>

  <p class="p">On a <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/glossary.html#topic6187__term-cluster">cluster</a>
installation, the IP address in /etc/hosts will identify the node
hosting the MBUS, usually the same as the Cloud Controller. On this
node, you will see a correspondence between the network interface
<samp class="ph codeph">eth0</samp> address and <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp>
for example DEA nodes, <samp class="ph codeph">eth0</samp> will be configured
with its own address on the same subnet, but <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp> will remain the same..</p>

<p class="p">If modifying <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp> becomes necessary because
of a hostname change, you can simply edit it as in the following
example:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">sudo vi /etc/hosts</pre>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic31232__server-config-dns"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">DNS</h2> 
  <p class="p">The Application Lifecycle Service micro cloud uses <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/glossary.html#topic6187__term-multicast-dns">multicast DNS</a> to broadcast its generated hostname (e.g. <samp class="ph codeph">helion-xxxx.local</samp>). This mechanism is intended for VMs running on a local machine or subnet.</p>

<p class="p">For production use, the server will need:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">a public DNS record,</li>

<li class="li">a wildcard CNAME record, and</li>

<li class="li">a fixed IP address.</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">For example, a DNS zone file for "helion.example.com" might contain:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">helion.example.com        IN    A        10.3.30.200
*.helion.example.com      IN    CNAME    helion.example.com</pre>

<p class="p">The wildcard CNAME record enables routing for the hostnames created for
each application pushed to Application Lifecycle Service. If your networking policy forbids
the use of wildcard records, you will need to add DNS records for each
application pushed to Application Lifecycle Service as well as the following two hostnames:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">api.</strong> - API endpoint for clients and the URL of the Management
Console (e.g. api.helion.example.com)</li>

<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">aok.</strong> - AOK authentication endpoint (e.g.
aok.helion.example.com)</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">If you intend to expose your applications at URLs on other domains (e.g.
  using <a class="xref" href="../../user/reference/client-ref-management.html#topic50918__command-map">helion map</a> add these names
to the DNS zone file as well. For example:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">app.domain.com              IN    CNAME    helion.example.com</pre>

<p class="p">Firewalls and load balancers may require corresponding adjustments.</p>

provider, such as <a class="xref" href="http://www.changeip.com/" target="_blank">ChangeIP</a>
and
<a class="xref" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS#Registering_with_a_Dynamic_DNS_provider" target="_blank">others</a>,
to provide DNS records. You will need one that provides wildcard
subdomain assignment.</p>

<p class="p">Before registering your domain, be sure that your mail server will
accept email from the provider (for example
<samp class="ph codeph">support@changeip.com</samp>).</p>

<p class="p">Create an account, choose a subdomain, and ensure that a wildcard
assignment is made on the subdomain to handle <samp class="ph codeph">api</samp>
and related application subdomains. Then wait to receive the
authorization email, and verify the zone transfer before proceeding.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic31232__alternate-dns-techniques"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alternate DNS Techniques</h2> 
<p class="p">For situations where mDNS will not work (e.g. running in a cloud hosting
environment or connecting from a Windows system without mDNS support)
but which do not merit the effort of manually configuring a DNS record
(e.g. a test server) alternative methods are available.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic31232__xip-io"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">xip.io</h2> 
<p class="p">The quickest way to get wildcard DNS resolution is to use the
<a class="xref" href="http://xip.io/" target="_blank">xip.io</a> service.  This is the approach taken on clusters created with the Horizon Management Console panel or Application Lifecycle Service Installer CLI, and is done as part of the setup process.</p>

<p class="p">
        <a class="xref" href="#topic31232__server-config-hostname">Change your hostname</a>
        using <a class="xref" href="../reference/kato-ref.html#topic39432__kato-command-ref-node-attach">kato node rename</a> to match the external IP address with the 'xip.io'
        domain appended. For example:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">kato node rename 10.9.8.7.xip.io</pre>

<p class="p">This will change the system hostname and reconfigure some internal
Application Lifecycle Service settings. The xip.io DNS servers will resolve the domain
'10.9.8.7.xip.io' and all sub-domains to '10.9.8.7'. This works for
private subnets as well as public IP addresses.</p>

<p class="p">You may need to add site-specific DNS nameservers manually if the

resolve internal hosts using a particular nameserver.</p>

<p class="p">To explicitly add a DNS nameserver to an Application Lifecycle Service VM running under DHCP,
edit <em class="ph i">/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</em> and add a line with the DNS server IP.
For example:</p>
