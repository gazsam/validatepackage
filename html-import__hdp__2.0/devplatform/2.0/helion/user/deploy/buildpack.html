<a class="xref" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks" target="_blank">Buildpacks</a> are
bundles of detection and configuration scripts which set up containers
to run applications.</p>

<p class="p">Application deployment is done primarily using buildpacks, and the syntax for specifying which buildpack to use has changed. Instead of using a BUILDPACK_URL environment variable, set the buildpack's Git URL in a  <strong class="ph b">buildpack</strong>  key at the top level of <em class="ph i">manifest.yml</em>.</p>

<p class="p">Buildpacks are the recommended method for deploying applications to Application Lifecycle Service. Buildpacks replace the built-in frameworks used in previous versions.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic3370__built-in-buildpacks"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Built-In Buildpacks</h2> 
<p class="p">Application Lifecycle Service will cycle through the <em class="ph i">detect</em> scripts of the built-in buildpacks prior to staging to match the code you are pushing. For most applications using the built-in buildpacks, no additional ALS configuration is required.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic3370__legacy-buildpack"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Legacy Buildpack</h2> 
<p class="p">The legacy buildpack is a special meta-buildpack for deploying applications configured for Cloud Foundry v1 without the need for extensive reconfiguration.</p>

<p class="p">To use the Legacy buildpack: specify the <strong class="ph b">framework</strong> type for your application (e.g. php,
play, rails3, sinatra, java_web, java_ee, etc.). You can optionally
set a specific <strong class="ph b">runtime</strong> as well. For example:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">name: bottle-py3
framework:
  type: python
  runtime: python32</pre>

<div class="p">
  <div class="note restriction"><span class="restrictiontitle">Restriction:</span>  When using the Legacy buildpack, config-defined environment variable
          values can only be updated by re-pushing the entire application with the new settings.
          Changes to variables made in the Management Console will be overwritten by the original
          ones defined at push when the application is restarted. To modify custom environment
          variables, re-push the application after changing the values in
            <span class="ph filepath">manifest.yml</span>. </div>

      </div>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic3370__custom-buildpacks"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Custom Buildpacks</h2> 
<p class="p">To specify the exact buildpack to use for deploying your application,
set a top-level <samp class="ph codeph">buildpack:</samp> key in <em class="ph i">manifest.yml</em> to the URL of the buildpack's Git repository. For example:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">name: myrubyapp
mem: 256MB
buildpack: https://github.com/hpcloud/stackato-buildpack-ruby.git</pre>

<p class="p">You can use a specific branch by specifying it at the end of the URL using the following format:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">buildpack: https://github.com/hpcloud/stackato-buildpack-ruby.git#branchname</pre>

<p class="p">There are hundreds of buildpacks available on Github. Searching Github for the term "buildpack" and the name of the language or framework you wish to deploy may provide you with a working solution, or at least the starting point for your own custom buildpack.</p>

<div class="p">
        <div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">Not all Heroku buildpacks work with ALS due to environmental differences such as
          relying on the presence of certain executables or libraries in Heroku-specific locations.
          Examine and test any buildpack carefully before using it in production deployments.</div>

      </div>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Using <em class="ph i">config_vars</em> in a buildpack's <em class="ph i">bin/release</em> to set environment
        variables has been deprecated. Use a shell script in <em class="ph i">$HOME/.profile.d</em> instead.</div>

</div>

<div class="section" id="topic3370__procfile"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Procfile</h2> 
<p class="p">Buildpacks will usually contain a <strong class="ph b">default_process_type</strong> setting with the command used to start the application process. If your application needs a custom command to start the process, create a Procfile in the base directory of your application.</p>

<p class="p">The Procfile should contain a single line defining the <strong class="ph b">web:</strong> <strong class="ph b">
<em class="ph i">process</em>
</strong> for the application defined. For example:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT</pre>

<p class="p">ALS does not support multiple process types in the Procfile. To launch a <em class="ph i">worker</em> process, create a separate app with an empty URL ( <strong class="ph b">url: [ ]</strong> ) in <em class="ph i">manifest.yml</em>.</p>
