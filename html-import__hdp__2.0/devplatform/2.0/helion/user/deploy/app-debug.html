<div class="body">
<p class="p">Different languages have different tools and protocols for remote
debugging, but most require a connection between the running application
code and the debugging tool or IDE on a port and protocol other than
standard HTTP(S).</p>

<p class="p">Application Lifecycle Service makes this possible through the <a class="xref" href="../services/port-service.html">Harbor port service</a>, and the
  <a class="xref" href="../reference/client-ref-management.html#topic50918__command-push"><em class="ph i">push</em></a> command has
a <samp class="ph codeph">-d</samp> option to set up port forwarding for a remote
debugging session automatically.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic1398__helion-debug-command"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">HELION_DEBUG_COMMAND</h2> 
<p class="p">The command-line client can automatically start a local debugger client or IDE instance with connection information for a newly pushed application.</p>

<p class="p">When the <samp class="ph codeph">-d</samp> debugging option is given to
  <a class="xref" href="../reference/client-ref-management.html#topic50918__command-push">
<em class="ph i">push</em>
</a> command,
the client looks for a HELION_DEBUG_COMMAND environment variable. If
present, the command specified in that variable is run after the push
completes as child process in the foreground (i.e. blocking the parent
<samp class="ph codeph">helion</samp> process) in the local application source
directory.</p>

<p class="p">Special <samp class="ph codeph">%HOST%</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">%PORT%</samp> variables can be used in this command, which
are replaced with the hostname or IP address and port number of the new
Harbor debugging service.</p>
