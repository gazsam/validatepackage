  <div class="body"><div class="section">
    <p class="p">This Helion Development Platform release introduces the ability to deploy Docker images. This example takes an existing app and creates a
      Docker image that will run in ALS and take advantage of the provisioned services. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Start With a New Stack</h2>
      
      <p class="p">One of the advantages to using Docker is the ability to run different flavors of Linux.
        While ALS is based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Docker images can be based on a different distro,
        such as Debian, CentOS, or even Alpine Linux images. This example uses the openSUSE base
        image. </p>

      <p class="p">Docker can compartmentalize system configuration into separate Docker layers, either by
        breaking up configuration steps into separate RUN directives in a single Dockerfile, or by
        creating separate images and chaining them together with the FROM directive at the top of
        each separate Dockerfile. This example includes both methods.</p>

 Before attempting to create Docker applications, ensure you have
      the following: <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">A DockerHub account.</li>

        <li class="li">On OSX you also need Boot2Docker installed and running. [Boot2Docker does not need
            <samp class="ph codeph">sudo</samp> commands.]</li>

        <li class="li">On a Linux machine you also need Docker.</li>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Update and Installing Operating System Packages</h2>
        <p class="p">Create a Dockerfile with the content below. This Dockerfile executes an update using the
        package manager; on openSUSE, this is done with <samp class="ph codeph">zypper</samp>. </p>

        <div class="p">The openSUSE base image is intentionally minimal, so this also installs:

</div>

<p class="p">These installations provide the tools that are most likely necessary to script the installation of a Python application, try things out interactively in a locally running Docker container, or troubleshoot apps (through an ssh session).</p>

      
      <p class="p">Notice that a couple of commands were chained together in the RUN statement.
      Every time a RUN command is used in a Dockerfile, it generates another image layer, and there's a hard
      limit of 127 layers in the current versions of Docker (the AUFS default limit). Bundling
      related commands together reduces the number of layers, helping ensure that the maximum is not exceeded.
      If there are relatively few layers, having the update and package install steps in separate RUN commands can take advantage of Docker's ability to
      use cached layers when rebuilding, which can speed up the build significantly.</p>

      </div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Build, test, and push Docker Images</h2> 
      <p class="p">The new "base+1" image layer is named '<em class="ph i">&lt;myrepo&gt;</em>/opensuse-python'. </p>
<p class="p">To build it, run this command in a directory that is empty
      except for the Dockerfile:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"> $ sudo docker build --no-cache -t &lt;myrepo&gt;/opensuse-python .</pre>
<p class="p">In this case, <samp class="ph codeph">--no-cache</samp> is used to ensure that the <samp class="ph codeph">zypper</samp> update runs each time it builds, rather than relying on the cached image layer from previous builds.</p>

        <p class="p">After the build completes, open an interactive shell and verify that it went as expected:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">sudo docker run -i -t troytop/opensuse-python /bin/sh 
sh-4.2# pip -V
pip 1.5 from /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7) 
sh-4.2# exit </pre>
 
        <p class="p">Note that if an app is to be shared, it should be pushed to the <a class="xref" href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>
        or other registry server:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">$ sudo docker push &lt;myrepo&gt;/opensuse-python</pre>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Create an Application Container:<em class="ph i"> bottle-currency-suse</em></h2><p class="p">First,
        clone the Docker version of the example app (bottle-currency). This app is based on Ubuntu
        12.04, so the Dockerfile can be adapted to work with an opensuse-python image.</p>
<div class="p">
        <pre class="pre codeblock">git clone <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/Stackato-Apps/bottle-currency.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/Stackato-Apps/bottle-currency.git</a></pre>

      </div>
<p class="p"> Once the project is cloned, create a Docker file using the following the
      steps:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">FROM <em class="ph i">&lt;myrepo&gt;</em>/opensuse-python 
MAINTAINER <em class="ph i">&lt;myname&gt; &lt;myemail&gt;</em></pre>
Use
      a different container as a starting point and identify yourself as the maintainer.
      <pre class="pre codeblock">RUN useradd -d /home/www -m -s /bin/bash www 
USER www 
WORKDIR /home/www</pre>
This
      creates a new user called <samp class="ph codeph">www</samp> and sets the active user and the working
        directory.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For maximum security, no app should run as root unless absolutely
        necessary.</div>
<pre class="pre codeblock">COPY . . </pre>
Since the Dockerfile exists in the base
      directory of the bottle-currency sources, this command will recursively copy the contents of
      the current directory into the WORKDIR defined above.
      <pre class="pre codeblock">RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt </pre>
This installs the modules
      required by the application. With a staged application, this part would be handled by the
      buildpack instead. <pre class="pre codeblock">EXPOSE 8080</pre>
Without a $PORT environment variable,
      apps default to running on port 8080. This command EXPOSEs the default port in the container
      so that it's routed to an external port on the DEA host. The ALS router will in turn be able
      to route to the app by forwarding external requests to this <em class="ph i">hostname:port</em>.<p class="p">With
        Docker Apps, only one port must be exposed. When running a staged app, the application code
        or the Procfile would have to reference the $PORT variable provided in the
      container.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">CMD python wsgi.py</pre>
This command starts the web process. In
      a staged app, this would be specified in a Procfile. Now that the Dockerfile is ready, the
      next step is to create, test and push the image.repeat the same steps used for the
      opensuse-python image to build, test, and push the image. <p class="p">To build it, run this command in
        a directory that is empty except for the
      Dockerfile:</p>
<pre class="pre">$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t &lt;myrepo&gt;/bottle-currency-suse .</pre>
Assuming
      all work was done on localhost, connecting to <samp class="ph codeph">http://localhost:8000 </samp>with a
      browser will show the running web app, but the error message "An error occurred while
      contacting the server" will appear. The conversion app does not function yet because it
      requires a Redis data service. <p class="p">Push the new image to the Docker Hub:
      </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">sudo docker push &lt;myrepo&gt;/bottle-currency-suse</pre>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deploying the App</h2><p class="p">The bottle-currency app looks for a Redis data service
        exposed by a REDIS_URL environment variable. <a class="xref" href="../reference/environment.html#topic7631">Environment variables</a>
        (VCAP_SERVICES) are injected into the Docker containers to provide connection information
        for any services that have been bound to the app. This is the <a class="xref" href="http://12factor.net/config" target="_blank">12-Factor method</a>,
        which has always been standard practice for Cloud Foundry. </p>
Deploy the app with the
      following
      command:<pre class="pre codeblock">helion push -n --docker-image &lt;myrepo&gt;/bottle-currency-suse --mem 128 --as docker-currency</pre>
This
      fetches the Docker image from the Hub and deploys it, but without a database.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> There are a
        number of ways to parse environment variables when connecting to the data services. If you
        are deploying a Docker image written by a third party, the credentials provided by ALS will
        need to be reformatted into variables that the app can understand. To do this, add another
        layer on top of the third-party image which parses the provided environment variables,
        reformats them in a way the app will understand, and reiterates the CMD / ENTRYPOINT line
        from the original image.</div>
