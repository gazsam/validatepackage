<div class="body">
<p class="p">The Management Console is a web interface for Application Lifecycle Service (ALS). Using the same API as the Helion CLI client, it provides access to a subset of features for deploying, scaling, and configuring applications as well as monitoring quota usage, and viewing logs.</p>

<p class="p">The interface differs for Admin and non-Admin users. The features described below are available and visible to end users. For information on the Management Console view for Admins, see the <a class="xref" href="../../admin/console/console_index.html">Console Admin Guide</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic8844__app-list"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Applications List</h2> 
<p class="p">The Applications list is accessible from the top menu. It shows all applications deployed under the current user's Organizations.</p>

<p class="p">The list shows:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">the application name</li>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">Summary</strong>: General information about the app including its description (optional), which buildpack it uses, when it was created, and when it was last modified. The application state will appear in parentheses beside the application name, and will be one of the following:

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">Staging</strong>: currently staging the application droplet.</li>

<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">Staging Failed. Check Logs</strong>: staging of application droplet has failed</li>

<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">Down</strong>: successfully staged as a droplet and application instances have been created, but all instances are down. This state will typically not be seen as any one instance will only be down for a short period of time before starting or being removed.</li>

<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">Offline</strong>: successfully staged the application droplet, but no application instances have been created and started.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">Environment Variables</strong>: Environment variables that have been explicitly set in the application container (via application config, client commands, or this interface). Default variables, those set by the application framework, or those added by the system for data services are excluded from this view.</li>

<li class="li">
<strong class="ph b">Settings</strong>: The number of application instances, disk space, and memory allotment used by the application. This usage counts against the organization's quota.</li>
