<div class="body">
<p class="p">Welcome! The HPE Helion Development Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that helps
      developers build great cloud-native applications across private and public clouds. Based on
        <a class="xref" href="http://cloudfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Cloud
          Foundry™</a> and fully integrated with <a class="xref" href="http://docs.hpcloud.com/#helion/index.html" target="_blank">HPE Helion
          OpenStack<sup>®</sup></a>, the HPE Helion Development Platform is open and
      interoperable, ensuring that developers can focus on building the right app for any
      environment.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic5490__platform-overview"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Platform Overview</h2> 
<p class="p">The Helion Development Platform is a Cloud Foundry-based, managed runtime environment for applications.</p>

<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li">It supports <a class="xref" href="devplatform.appdev.html#topic2457__java">Java</a>, <a class="xref" href="devplatform.appdev.html#topic2457__node">Node</a>, <a class="xref" href="devplatform.appdev.html#topic2457__PHP">PHP</a>, and other language runtimes.</li>

<li class="li">It provides easy access to services like MySQL, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Memcache.</li>

<li class="li">It allows Disk, Memory and Placement Zone constraints to be set per application.</li>

<li class="li">It provides auto-scaling and application log drains.</li>

</ul>

      <p class="p">The Application Lifecycle Service is <a class="xref" href="installation/devplatform_install_ALS.html">installed</a> as part of the Helion Development Platform. You can easily <a class="xref" href="helion/admin/helion_admin_index.html#topic2276__wizard-based-cluster-creation">create and configure</a> Application Lifecycle Service clusters from the
        Horizon management console.</p>

<p class="p">Helion Development Platform now includes a full end-to-end solution for creating and deploying .NET  applications. Windows developers can now leverage their knowledge and use the tools they are accustomed to in order to leverage the power of the Helion Development Platform. For more information on Windows and .NET support, see the <a class="xref" href="windows/windows_overview.html">Windows Overview</a>.</p>

<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li">An implementation of <a class="xref" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Trove" target="_blank">OpenStack Trove</a>, <a class="xref" href="database/devplatform.database-instance.html">Database as a Service</a> provides scalable and reliable cloud database provisioning functionality for both relational and non-relational databases.  </li>

<li class="li">The Database service provides a simple and easy way to access and utilize features in a database without the overhead of administration.  </li>

</ul>

      <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="database/devplatform.database-ALS.html">Database as a Service</a> is
        optionally <a class="xref" href="installation/devplatform_install_database.html">installed and configured</a> as part of the Helion Development Platform. If not
        installed as part of the platform, you can install it and then configure it for <a class="xref" href="database/devplatform.database-ALS.html">use from within the Application Lifecycle
          Service</a>.</p>

          about installing, configuring, or troubleshooting.</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">The Messaging Service is optionally installed as part of the Helion Development Platform.
        If not installed as part of the platform, you can <a class="xref" href="installation/devplatform_install_messaging.html">install</a> it and then <a class="xref" href="messaging/devplatform.using-the-messaging-service.html">configure</a> it for
