  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">If downloading directly to the Deployer is not an option for security or other reasons, you
      can pre-download the installation packages for use during installation.</p>

    <p class="p">The pre-download also eliminates the possibility of connection interruptions during
      installation. </p>

    <ol class="ol" id="topic_w25_hqp_xt__ol_bmh_vqp_xt">
      <li class="li">Using your preferred Web browser, navigate to the <a class="xref" href="https://helion.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html#/Home/Show" target="_blank">HPE Helion Download Network</a> (HDN) and log in. If necessary, create
        an account first.</li>

      <li class="li">Click on the <strong class="ph b">Download</strong> button in the left navigation panel.</li>

      <li class="li">Click the service you wish to download. Click the blue <strong class="ph b">Download</strong> button at the top
        right of the screen to begin the download. </li>

      <li class="li">The best option is to download directly to the HPE Helion OpenStack Deployer. If you can
        not download directly to the HPE Helion OpenStack deployer, copy all the downloaded packages
        to a USB stick or external hard drive and then copy the files onto the physical machine
        hosting the HPE Helion OpenStack Deployer. Make sure there is enough space; the file sizes
        can be significant.</li>

      <li class="li">Follow the installation instructions provided for each service.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When installing
          pre-downloaded files, make sure you run the installer from the same directory where the
          installation files are. If the installer cannot find a file with the name you provided in
          the local directory, it will attempt to download the files again. </div>
