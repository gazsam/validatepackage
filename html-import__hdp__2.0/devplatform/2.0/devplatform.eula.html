        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Applicability.</strong> This end user license agreement (the "Agreement") governs the use
          of accompanying HPE Helion Development Platform Software ("Software"), unless it is subject
          to a separate agreement between you and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and its subsidiaries
          ("HPE"). By downloading, copying, or using the Software you agree to this Agreement.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Terms.</strong> This Agreement includes supporting material accompanying the Software or
          referenced by HPE which may be software license information, additional license
          authorizations, software specifications, published warranties, supplier terms, open source
          software licenses and similar content ("Supporting Material"). Additional license
          authorizations are below and at <a class="xref" href="devplatform.thirdparty.licensing.html">http://docs.hpcloud.com/devplatform/2.0/devplatform.thirdparty.licensing.html</a>.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Authorization</strong>. If you agree to this Agreement on behalf of another person or
          entity, you warrant you have authority to do so.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Consumer Rights.</strong> If you obtained Software as a consumer, nothing in this Agreement
          affects your statutory rights.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Electronic Delivery.</strong> HPE may elect to deliver Software and related software product
          or license information by electronic transmission or download.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">License Grant.</strong> If you abide by this Agreement, HPE grants you a non-exclusive,
          non-transferable license to use one copy of the version or release of the accompanying
          Software for your Internal Use only; this license is subject to any specific software
          licensing information that is in the Software product or its Supporting Material. Your use
          is subject to the following restrictions, unless specifically allowed in Supporting
          Material: <ol class="ol" type="a">
            <li class="li">You may not use Software to provide products or services to third parties.</li>

            <li class="li">You may not make copies and distribute, resell, sublicense or provide access to the
              Software to third parties.</li>

            <li class="li">You may not download and use patches, enhancements, bug fixes, or similar updates
              unless you have a license to the underlying Software. However, such license doesn't
              automatically give you a right to receive such updates and HPE reserves the right to
              make such updates only available to customers with support contracts.</li>

            <li class="li">You may not copy Software or make it available on a public or external distributed
              network.</li>

            <li class="li">You may not allow access on an intranet unless it is restricted to authorized
              users.</li>

            <li class="li">You may make one copy of the software for archival purposes or when it is an
              essential step in authorized use.</li>

            <li class="li">You may not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt, decompile, or make
              derivative works of Software except as permitted by law.</li>

          </ol>
</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Remote Monitoring.</strong> Some software may require keys or other technical protection
          measures and HPE may monitor your compliance with the Agreement, remotely or otherwise. If
          HPE makes a license management program for recording and reporting license usage
          information, you will use such program no later than 180 days from the date it's made
          available.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Ownership.</strong> No transfer of ownership of any intellectual property will occur under
          this Agreement.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Copyright Notices.</strong> You must reproduce copyright notices on software and
          documentation for authorized copies.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">90-day Limited Warranty for HPE Software.</strong> HPE-branded software is free of malware
          at the time of delivery; if you notify HPE within 90 days of delivery of non-conformance
          to this warranty, HPE will replace your copy. This Agreement states all remedies for
          warranty claims. <p class="p">HPE does not warrant that the operation of software will be
            uninterrupted or error free, or that software will operate in hardware and software
            combinations other than as authorized by HPE in Supporting Material. To the extent
            permitted by law, HPE disclaims all other warranties.</p>
</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Intellectual Property Rights Infringement.</strong>  Subject to Section 14(e) of this Part
          1, HPE will defend and/or settle any claims against you that allege that HPE-branded
          software as supplied under this Agreement infringes the intellectual property rights of a
          third party. HPE will rely on your prompt notification of the claim and cooperation with
          our defense. HPE may modify the software so as to be non-infringing and materially
          equivalent, or we may procure a license. If these options are not available, we will
          refund to you the amount paid for the affected product in the first year or the
          depreciated value thereafter. HPE is not responsible for claims resulting from any
          unauthorized use of the software.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Limitation of Liability.</strong> HPE's liability to you under this Agreement is limited to
          the amount actually paid by you to HPE for the relevant software, except for amounts in
          Section 11 ("Intellectual Property Rights Infringement"). Neither you nor HPE will be
          liable for lost revenues or profits, downtime costs, loss or damage to data or indirect,
          special or consequential costs or damages. This provision does not limit either party's
          liability for: unauthorized use of intellectual property, death or bodily injury caused by
          their negligence; acts of fraud; willful repudiation of the Agreement; or any liability
          that may not be excluded or limited by applicable law.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Termination.</strong> This Agreement is effective until terminated or in the case of a
          limited-term license, upon expiration; however, your rights under this Agreement terminate
          if you fail to comply with it. Immediately upon termination or expiration, you will
          destroy the software and documentation and any copies, or return them to HPE. You may keep
          one copy of software and documentation for archival purposes. We may ask you to certify in
          writing you have complied with this section. Warranty disclaimers, the limitation of
          liability, this section on termination, and Section 14 ("General") will survive
          termination.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">14. General.</strong>
          <ol class="ol" type="a">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Assignment</strong>. You may not assign this Agreement without prior written consent
              of HPE, payment of transfer fees, and compliance with HPE's software license transfer
              policies. Authorized assignments will terminate your license to the software and you
              must deliver software and documentation and copies thereof to the assignee. The
              assignee will agree in writing to this Agreement. You may only transfer firmware if
              you transfer associated hardware.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">U.S. Government</strong>. If the software is licensed to you for use in the
              performance of a U.S. Government prime contract or subcontract, you agree that,
              consistent with FAR 12.211 and 12.212, commercial computer software, computer software
              documentation and technical data for commercial items are licensed under HPE's
              standard commercial license.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Global Trade Compliance</strong>. You agree to comply with the trade-related laws and
              regulations of the U.S. and other national governments. If you export, import or
              otherwise transfer products provided under this Agreement, you will be responsible for
              obtaining any required export or import authorizations. You confirm that you are not
              located in a country that is subject to trade control sanctions (currently Cuba, Iran,
              N. Korea, N. Sudan, and Syria) and further agree that you will not retransfer the
              products to any such country. HPE may suspend its performance under this Agreement to
              the extent required by laws applicable to either party.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Audit</strong>. HPE may audit you for compliance with the software license terms. Upon
              reasonable notice, HPE may conduct an audit during normal business hours (with the
              auditor's costs being at HPE's expense). If an audit reveals underpayments then you
              will pay to HPE such underpayments. If underpayments discovered exceed five (5)
              percent, you will reimburse HPE for the auditor costs</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Third Party and Open Source Components</strong>. To the extent any component of the
              software is subject to any third party license terms, including open source license
              terms, then those third party license terms or open source license terms shall govern
              with respect to the subject component; otherwise, the terms of this Agreement shall
              govern.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Notices</strong>. Written notices under this Agreement may be provided to HPE via the
              method provided in the Supporting Material or if none, via "contact HPE" site on <a class="xref" href="http://www.hp.com" target="_blank">www.hp.com</a>.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Governing Law</strong>. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of
              California, U.S.A., excluding rules as to choice and conflict of law. You and HPE
              agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
              Goods will not apply.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Force Majeure</strong>. Neither party will be liable for performance delays nor for
              non-performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, except for payment
              obligations.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Entire Agreement</strong>. This Agreement represents our entire understanding with
              respect to its subject matter and supersedes any previous communication or agreements
              that may exist. Modifications to the Agreement will be made only through a written
              amendment signed by both parties. If HPE doesn't exercise its rights under this
              Agreement, such delay is not a waiver of its rights.</li>
